## Overview

Santo Dental Group, a reputable dental practice in Red Bank, New Jersey, sought to modernize their online presence to better reflect their dedication to patient care and to provide an enhanced user experience. The project involved a comprehensive redesign of their website using Figma for prototyping and Webflow for development, aiming to create a seamless, informative, and visually appealing platform for both current and prospective patients.

## Key Features

  Created dedicated pages detailing each service offered, such as Family & General Dentistry, Cosmetic & Restorative Dentistry, Pediatric Dentistry, and more, providing visitors with comprehensive information.

- **Meet the Team Section:**

- **Patient Resources:**
  Integrated resources like new patient forms, financing options, and a patient portal, streamlining access to essential information.

  Implemented an easy-to-use online scheduling system, allowing patients to book appointments directly through the website.

## Technologies Used

  Leveraged for managing dynamic content, enabling easy updates to service pages, team member profiles, and blog posts.

## Challenges and Learnings

One significant challenge was ensuring that the website accurately conveyed the warm and welcoming atmosphere of Santo Dental Group's practice while maintaining a professional and trustworthy appearance. This required a careful balance of design elements, color schemes, and imagery. Additionally, integrating third-party systems for appointment scheduling and patient portals necessitated meticulous planning to ensure a seamless user experience.
